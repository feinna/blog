The excruciating details
-Schedule for the weekend-

## Friday 7 February: dinner and activities
If you're arriving on Friday, come have dinner out in Newport with us at Siam Kitchen.

If we're not all tired, we may go out somewhere afterward. Options include:
- Fortress
- Cinema
- Dancing (venue suggestions welcome)

## Saturday 8 February: breakfast, formality, games and beach
Morning: 9:30am
We are having brunch at our place. We will email out the address to all RSVPs.

EARLY Afternoon: 3pm
The wedding ceremony will be in the Margaret Craig Room at the Old Treasury Building.
Parliament Station is the nearest train station. We will be taking the train in.

LATE AFTERNOON: 4pm - 11:30PM
Our reception venue opens at 4pm, which is about how long it will take us to do photos and then catch the train to Altona. At the reception we will have food, drinks, board games, and at least one AI-generated speech.
Getting to the venue by public transport: If you've joined us for the ceremony, you'll want to get the train at Parliament Station to North Melbourne, get off the train, go to platform 6, and wait for the train to Werribee that mentions going to Altona, which is the station you will want to exit the train at. Please note that not every train on this platform will go to Altona, as it is part of a 'loop' that runs occasionally.
Getting to the venue by car: If you've brought your car with you, then you'll be heading to 5 Sargood Street, Altona. We may task you with picking items up from a nearby supermarket, so if you're able to do this, let us know.

Golden Hour
We plan to walk down to the beach at the magical photography time of 'golden hour' and take some photos on the beach with the pretty sun and water and sand. You're very welcome to join us, and we'll make an announcement at the time that we are heading down.

## Sunday 9 February: the beach day
Morning: MIDDAY
After a slow breakfast, we will be heading down to the beach for the day. You're very welcome to come. It will be a very informal affair of lazing, beach cricket, tunes, waves, and chip eating. Stay as long as you like.

## FAQs
What is the dress code?
Business casual is probably appropriate. It's summer so don't feel like you have to wear a jacket, but something without stains would be great. Jenn won't be in a wedding dress, James won't be in a suit, but we will both look nice and like we at least tried a bit. If in doubt, feel free to send us a picture to check.

Do you want presents?
No, thank you.

Do you have a facebook event page?
Yes, James has made one.

Why does the title say 'protected'
Because Wordpress is silly and it's the way that it lets me password protect this page.
